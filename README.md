# MangaParser
##Goal

Enhance the reading experience by isolating panels and allowing reconstruction on digital devices.
and allow for more flexible writing.
Ideally this would be performed in a self-supervised manner, or using adversarial methods.

## Features
  * extract panels from mangas/comics/graphic novels
  * identify characters
  * build a graph of characters
  * reorder/rewrite according to other character's perspectives

# Rise Above

This is about forming a charity on mental health around an absolutely crazy concept: 
Tall bikes are safer than regular bikes.

This truth was always self-evident to myself and my friend Spencer Clark, with which I built a few frankenbikes during 
our university years.

# Tic-Tac-Go app

  This is about building simple app for "competitive exploration" amongst friends and family. People would gather a 
  collective list of things to so, e.g.:
  * series to binge watch
  * restaurants to eat at
  * recipes to cook
and once the list is made, a grid would be filled with the items and they would play tic-tac-toe to be the first to align
4 or 5 of them.

This is not technically difficult as the backend should be relatively simple and so should the interface.

# Roll Me Closer

This is an intimacy building game based on competitive slot machine play.

# EscherNet

 A machine learning algorithm that creates tesselations with representations of objects.
 
## Features

* user enters a word and gets a proposition of duals to tesselate with.

# HomeFitter

<font color=red>!! This is already implemented by [MyVeloFit](https://www.myvelofit.com/?utm_source=insta&utm_medium=linktree&utm_campaign=home) !!</font>

  This is a mobile application to help customers with bicycle purchases, enhance the experience of custom bike orders,
  streamline the workflow for independent bicycle builders and eventually help manufacturers with stock management.

It should have multiple features:
* skeleton structure extraction from live video
  * Customers provide their height
  * put their phone on the floor and follow some stretching exercises
  * They get some info on their position (inside height, spine, hip pivot...)
  * They can watch their skeleton move on video
* Customer profile
  * They can track their flexibility and posture over time
  * They can see their current bike geometry
* Database
  * They can see a personal fit score on all the standard manufacturer's bikes and their different sizes.
  * They get pre-made custom frames for a range of bike types (commuter, road, MTB, touring, gravel)
* Cumstom builds Lobby
  * Customers can start conversation with independent frame builders and order a bicycle
  * Frame Builders can manage all their current orders, including:
    * communication with clients
    * parts ordering
    * tube ordering
    * technical drawing generation (integration with BikeCAD, via xml)
