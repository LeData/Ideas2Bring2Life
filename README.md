# Ideas2Bring2Life
Projects that I am carrying on my own and for whom I would love to collaborate.

Each of these are ideas that I would like to develop and for which I am looking for collaborators:

# MangaParser
##Goal

Enhance the reading experience by isolating panels and allowing reconstruction on digital devices.
and allow for more flexible writing.
Ideally this would be performed in a self-supervised manner, or using adversarial methods.

## Features
  * extract panels from mangas/comics/graphic novels
  * identify characters
  * build a graph of characters
  * reorder/rewrite according to other character's perspectives

# Rise Above

This is about forming a charity on mental health around an absolutely crazy concept: 
Tall bikes are safer than regular bikes.

This truth was always self-evident to myself and my friend Spencer Clark, with which I built a few frankenbikes during 
our university years.

# Tic-Tac-Go app

  This is about building simple app for "competitive exploration" amongst friends and family. People would gather a 
  collective list of things to so, e.g.:
  * series to binge watch
  * restaurants to eat at
  * recipes to cook
and once the list is made, a grid would be filled with the items and they would play tic-tac-toe to be the first to align
4 or 5 of them.

This is not technically difficult as the backend should be relatively simple and so should the interface.

# Roll Me Closer

This is an intimacy building game based on competitive slot machine play.
